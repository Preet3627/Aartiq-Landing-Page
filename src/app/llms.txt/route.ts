> An open-source browser with a built-in AI assistant, local LLM support (Ollama), permission-gated OS automation, background task scheduling, and E2EE cross-device sync. Built with Electron, Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Flutter. Dual-licensed on GitHub (Apache-2.0 browser core / MIT MCP server).

Aartiq is a privacy-focused browser that integrates AI directly into the browsing experience. It supports multiple AI providers (Gemini, GPT, Claude, Ollama), can execute OS-level automation through a permission-gated system, schedule background tasks, sync data across devices with end-to-end encryption, and generate PDFs/Excel/PPTX documents from JSON templates. Available on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.

## Product Philosophy

Aartiq is built on a small set of firm beliefs:

- **Local-first, privacy-first.** Your data stays yours. AI runs locally (Ollama) when you want it to, sync is end-to-end encrypted, and credentials live in an OS keychain — never in plaintext, never in the cloud by default.
- **AI-native, not AI-bolted-on.** The assistant is a first-class citizen of the browser, not a sidebar gadget. It can read, act, automate, and create with your explicit permission.
- **Human-in-the-loop, always.** Autonomy is permission-gated. Destructive actions require approval, biometrics, or QR confirmation. The machine proposes; the human disposes.
- **Open by default.** Aartiq is open source (Apache-2.0 browser core / MIT MCP server). Trust is verified by reading the code, not by reading a privacy policy.
- **Secure by architecture.** A six-layer defense-in-depth model — visual sandbox, syntactic firewall, human-in-the-loop, directory allowlist, OS-level sandboxing, and capability-scoped execution — keeps automation safe.
- **Empower, don't replace.** Aartiq augments human productivity: scheduling, document generation, research, and OS control, with the user firmly in control.
